We all wait for some one to save us.
but theyre not. No time to explain.
Alan! Wake up!
Take your laptop and run for Denver
and most of all,
Stay Alive |-/

logout; shutdown;
no sound; its out
im out and proud
an outcast now
I sue for peace
they don't release
lightning strikes me
Im on my leave I-
|
|
Drifting through the stars
with a broken heart
I had a head start
I got pretty far
I just got to fly
let me find my pride
gotta catch my ride
Imma take my time~
|
|
Talk smack, I'll hack
Please take me back
they dig me down
and let me drown
I scream, apauled,
"I've had it all!"
They think that my freadoms have sank
but they don't know that Im the kid in the rain~
