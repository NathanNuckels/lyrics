Mid-west Furfest
Feelin' down again
'Just do your best'
But I'm a Queer coded villn!

Imagine I am just
walkin' in the streets
and then someone asks me
'What does it mean?'
(Do you want to know?)
I look em in the eyes
and try to say some lies
Im dieing Im trying
but lately ive been fine
(Do you want to know??)

Welcome to my mind
An uncencored library with a bad design (-ighn -ighn)
Check the door! Swear that I locked it!
Nevernind its a Glass Closet.
(GLASS!!)

Oh, they see me and it hurts
so get ready for their burns
I know they still be seein' me but
I'm still secret keepin' these-

[low band]
Don't get me started on breakin' in your teeth
Cause I know a lot about comeing out of the Deep
You dont know what they will do to you!
You don't even know if they're true!
[high band]
Arnt you just a macrophile?
You reduce buildings to piles
How bout you just leave right now
And go trip over the whole town!
[low band]
I dont want you in denial
I just want you save
but I don't care what you say cause
you are still a big disgrace
[high band] Replace me!
[low  band] You know I'll try
[Ligh band] You took my bait
            My, mate
            I got my grace
[low  band] and I dont need a face.
[high band] 
HEI HEI!
You dont get toxic for me!
Keep the closet locked for me!
[low band]
Its my job to liberate you
but I must manipulate you
[high band]
STOP PRETENDING IM A ***
[low band]
Do they wanna know?
[high band]
no...

Welcome to my mind
an uncencored library with a bad design (-/a.i.en.uu/)
Check the door! Swear that I locked it!
Never mind, its a Glass Closet!
(GLASS!!)
Oh, they see me and it hurts
so get ready for their strong words
I know they still be seein' me
but I'm still Secret Keeping these-

These feelings... (or lack thereof)
These feelings... (or lack-)

[low band]
SECRET STASH
HIDE IT BEHIND GLASS
Don't let the poet-
they know it-
I'm holdin'
on to you
Oh
SECRET STASH
HIDE IT BEHIND GLASS
Don't let them take it
you'll make it
you will live another day

(GLASS!!)
