I need
to calm down
I'm in between
and will not leave
my-y
Lightning
strikes the ground
under my feet
I can't belive
How many secrets can I keep
before my time runs out


Pardon Alan Grey
You don't judge them for their
face or name change
I can't coexist
cause I don't get paied enough for this
She~ nee~ds to let me be me
for a little wile longer
but as long as we are hiding
She is only getting stronger

Lightning
strikes way
too close
to the mirror
I can't
wait to
get us
up out of here
Just let
me know
if she
is out
of my bed
cause I
got to
get her out of my head!

I want to be free
please
just leave me be
?
?
?

I want to belive
in free will but its so difficult
If you decive
then I'll get synical

They. Will. See.
Even if you don't want me to be
out there
fighting tention
...
you dont know my intentions.
cause You- 

gotta be lookin' at it
from a new perspective
No matter what you say
you won't be metting my directive
you'll be thinking
'everything is just still lookin' up'
litle did you know
that that was never quite enough
cause I want you to
take me back way back all in the day
When I could be honest
All I had to do was say
"Ivan said that he
 would be around for a while"
And I'd know that I would ????? miss the trial

Lightning
strikes way
too close
to the mirror
I can't
wait to
get us
up out of here
Just let
me know
if she
is out
of my bed
cause I
got to
get her out of my head!
