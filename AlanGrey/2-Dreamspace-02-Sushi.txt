Ten bucks and I'll draw
Any furry thats in your mind.
Ja know why?
Becasue my own mind is hard to find I'll
draw, anything you think of
raw, on paper with a ftal
flaw, of course it's hidden in the
center and I sit and wait for my artistic
dar-ka-ness to enter
regardless of the time
I knw that it will enter my mind
And then my only creativity will just be really hard to find.

This is my tulpa
I need somebody to hold us
SHE's a two foot dragon and likes climbing on my back and-
**** it Sushi! Let me go downstairs so I can get myself a snack
I can only talk to her when lieing in my bed
because if I am standing up she will not get out of my head
And
The internet says the pressure's normal but its kinda driving me mad
But its good to know what I want and what I really truely always had

Wake up my little fluffy friend
Its time to leave and find new ends
and make them meet
above my feet
and SAVE ME before I decend
from you
you need to find my wonderland
and then you hop inside our van
I dont feel like making a plan
But I guess you could hang with the band
