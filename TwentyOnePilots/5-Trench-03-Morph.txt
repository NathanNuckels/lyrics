cant stop thinking...
if and when...
now I see..
are truely...
'if' is purely panic
and 'when' is solumn sorrow
and one invades today
while the other spies tomarrow
we're sourounded
and we're hounded
theres no above or under
or arround it
for- above is blind belif
and under is sword to sleave
and arround is scientific mericale
lets pick above and see
for 'if' and 'when' we go above
the question still remains
are we still in love and is it
possible we feel the same
and thats when going under
starts to take my wonder but
untill that time I'll try to sing this
(If I keep moving they wont know)
I'll morph to someone else
(what they throw at me's too slow)
I'' morph to someone else
im just a ghost
I'll morph to some one else

he'll always try to stop me
that Nicolas Bourbaki
he's got
no friends
close but
those who know him
most
know he 
goes by
NICO
He told me I'm a copy
and when I'd hear him mock me
that's almost stopped me
Well,
we're sourounded
and we're hounded
theres no above or
a secret door
what are we here for
if not tu run through all our
tormentours
but untill that time
I'll try to sing this
(If I keep moving they wont know)
I'll morph to someone else
(what they throw at me's too slow)
I'' morph to someone else
im just a ghost
I'll morph to some one else
