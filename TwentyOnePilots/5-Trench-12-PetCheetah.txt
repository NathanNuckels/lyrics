I am on a island no one to confide
get that sreight eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure...

No
I move slow
I wanna stop time
I'll sit here till I find the problem
No

Ive gotta
p'cheetah
down in my-
bacement
I raised him
and bathed him
and named him Jason--
--Statham
I've trained him
to make me
these beats
Now my pet-
-cheetah's quicker the studio than on the street
Imma
get mine and
get going
Im showin
my faces
in just enough 
places
Im done with 
tip-toeing
Ill stay in
my room
my house is
the one where
the vultures are
perched on
the roof
get behind me I bet
this 'nepotistic' mindset
will help us
get ours as
we're growing
this clique means
so much to
this dude it
can make him
afraid of
his music
and be scared to death he could loose it.
No
I move slow
I wanna stop time
I sit here till I find the problem
No
I move slow
I wanna stop time
I sit here till I FIND THE PORBLEM
